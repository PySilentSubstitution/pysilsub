Introduction
============

Silent substitution is an elegant technique that uses pairs of lights to selectively stimulate inidividual classes of retinal photoreceptor whilst maintaining a constant level of activation in others. Given a multiprimary stimulation device whose output is well-characterised, we need to find the settings to produce light stimuli that satisfy the spectral requirements and constraints.
