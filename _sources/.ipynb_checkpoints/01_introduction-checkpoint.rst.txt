Introduction
============

Silent substitution is an elegant technique that uses pairs of lights to selectively stimulate inidividual classes of retinal photoreceptor whilst maintaining a constant level of activation in others. Given a multiprimary stimulation device whose output is well-characterised, we need to find the settings to produce light stimuli that satisfy the spectral requirements and constraints.

- The fundamental silent substitution, therefore, is constrained numerical optimisation of spectral data. 


A normal human retina contains rods, long-, medium-, and short-wavelength-sensetive (L, M, S) cones, and intrinsically photosensetive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) expressing the photopigment melanopsin in their axons and soma. Rods are responsible for low-light vision, cones for colour vision, and the ipRGCs regulate steady-state pupil size and circaidian factors. Each photoreceptor is tuned to specific wavelengths of light, as demonstrated in the figure below. 

These cone cells are responsible for colour vision, and the ipRGCs 


and each sublcass is tuned to different wavelengths. The spectral sensetivity curve describes the probablity of photon capture at a specific wavelength.

According to the `principle of univariance <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_univariance>`_, the intensity and spectral properties of a light stimulus can not be determined from the output. Therefore, colour is determined by comparing the putput of the different classes of photoreceptor after the light has been absorbed. 

Silent substitution is an elegant technique for preparing light stimuli that selectively target indivdual classes of photoreceptor on the retina.
